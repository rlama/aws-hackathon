# [Share Library](#markdown-header-share-library)

The **Share Library** is a **collection of tools for setting up social media share buttons**. A reworking of a reworking of the share utilities originally written by Nathanael Scott, it is intended for use in the production of features, interactives and more by the company's Presentation Development team.

**The library's old documentation is outdated and will, in time, be replaced. For now, see the source code for exactly what this library includes.**
