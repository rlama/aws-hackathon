  This file binds together the various components of the Fairfax Presentation Styles library. 

  To use this file in a project, include it like so:

  .../ css
      - main.scss <- File imports '_ffx-prez-styles.scss', e.g. @import 'libs/_ffx-prez-styles.scss' 
      - main.css  <- Main file above compiles to this
  ..../ lib
        - '_ffx-prez-styles.scss'
        - etc.

  See 'https://smacss.com/book/categorizing' for more on the system used to categorise the styling
  rules included.

// Base

/* 
  Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors (e.g. 'p', 'a',
  'input', rather than class selectors, etc.) but base rules could include attribute selectors, 
  pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors.

  We also use 'Base' to include variables broadly depended on by many other styles (e.g. colours,
  font and text styles).

// State

/*
  State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. 
  Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or 
  layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module 
  might look in different views like the home page or the inside page.
